# JetsProject

## Description
The purpose of the JetsProject is to import a list of jets from a text file. After that it will convert the list into a list of jets in the AirField. Once that happens, a menu method will be pulled up for a user to choose an item within the method. The user will be prompted to list the jets within the fleet, fly all jets, view the fastest jet, view the jet with the longest range, load all of the cargo jets, have a dog fight, add a passenger jet to the fleet, remove a jet from the fleet, or to quit the app. If the user decides to list the entire fleet, each model within the list or fleet of jets and will display all of the jets' information. If the user decides to fly all jets, the same information will display as well as the amount of time or range of flight that each jet is capable of. If the user decides to view the fastest jet, a method will iterate through the entire list to find the fastest jet and display it. On the other hand the same concept is applied for the option of finding the jet with the longest range, however now displaying the longest range through a variable calculation. If the user decides to load all of the cargo jets, the app will iterate through all of the jets to find instances of cargo planes and "load them". If the user chooses the Dogfight option, all instances of a Fighter jet will be called through a for loop to "fight". If the user decides to add a passenger jet to the fleet, the user will be prompted questions asking them for the information of the jet, then adding it to the fleet. If the user decides to remove a jet, a menu of all the jets in a list will display, once the user decides to input the index number, starting from 1, the jet that the user chose will be removed. These menus will repeat until the user decides to "quit" the app. Once the user decides to quit the app, an exiting message will display, then the app will terminate.

## Technologies used
The technologies used are importing and extending classes which allow the use of methods and adaption of these certain methods within the child class. 

methods were used to make the code within the jets app dry and easier to read by being called upon.

loops were used within the methods in order to iterate through the fleet and in the launch method to iterate through the users choice until they decide to quit.

github was used to push and display our code.

Eclipse was used to code the entire project.

A switch statement was used to iterate through each of the users choice.

git was used to push the files onto github.

ArrayLists were used to maintain the jets in order to remove and add as many jets as the user would like.

A file (Buffered) reader was used to extract the data from the text file.

A scanner was used to receive input from the user.

A try and catch statement was used to catch the errors if there was a missing text file or and error reading it.



## Lessons Learned
I learned that coding is very repetitive and that I need to find more ways to shorten it even more. For example during the switch statments and checking for inputs in general, there must be many cases that the user can put in. However, I learned after finishing it that I can limit the typing by changing the total casing of the input to lower or upper case. I also further solidified my understanding of call methods and overriding methods from parent classes or just through importing them. I further solidified my understanding of using variables to call to specific addresses, allowing to code with ease when calling methods.
